2. **Finger Counting:**
   - Description: Counting fingers using image processing techniques.

3. **Pose Estimation:**
   - Description: Detects human body pose and displays the frames per second (fps) of the video.

4. **Personal Trainer:**
   - Description: Virtual personal trainer for exercise guidance.

5. **Face Detection:**
   - Description: Detecting faces in images or videos.

6. **Face Mesh:**
   - Description: Creating a mesh representation of facial features using neural networks.

7. **Road Line Detection:**
   - Description: Detecting and tracking road lines for autonomous vehicles.

8. **Sleep Detection:**
   - Description: Tracking eye blinks using specific facial landmarks (FaceMesh).

9. **Virtual Gesture:**
   - Description: Tracking the position of two hands using hand tracking and zooming in or out on an image based on the distance between them.
